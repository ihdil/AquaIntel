Our project, **'Marine Environment Monitoring,'** uses AI to detect waste in the sea and on beaches from satellite images. It alerts environmental agencies about critical areas, providing details on location and waste type, and offers recommendations to address the issue effectively.

## **Project Goal:**

To utilize artificial intelligence to effectively monitor and mitigate marine pollution by detecting waste in the sea and on beaches.

## **Methodology:**

Satellite Image Analysis: Employ AI algorithms to analyze satellite imagery to identify and classify various types of marine waste, such as plastics, oil spills, and debris.
Priority Determination: Prioritize areas with the highest concentration of waste or the most significant environmental risks.
Notification and Recommendations: Send alerts to relevant environmental agencies, providing detailed information about the location, type, and severity of the pollution. Additionally, offer AI-driven recommendations for efficient cleanup and mitigation strategies.
Impact Assessment: Evaluate the potential environmental impact of the pollution, helping to guide cleanup efforts and resource allocation.

## **Expected Outcomes:**

Early Detection: Proactive identification of marine pollution incidents.
Efficient Response: Timely notification and targeted cleanup efforts.
Reduced Environmental Impact: Minimization of the adverse effects of marine pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Informed policy development and resource management based on AI-generated insights.
